3. Ingest function creates an entry in the table storage and adds a message on the identification queue
4. A new message on identification queue triggers the face function
5. Face function performs face detection, adds the face to the group, trains and performs identification. If a duplicate face is found, then it creates an entry on table storage and adds a message on the notification queue 
6. A new message on notification queue triggers the email function
7. Email function sends an email that a duplicate face has been found
